Task: Create Android application to display image feed from remote source.

Requirements:
- Display list of images in a scrollable GridView
- Display image title provided by feed on top of each image
- Download image list from online source (for example https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photos.getRecent)
- Download each image in background, update UI when image is ready
- UI must scroll smoothly

Nice to have:
- Cancel download requests when image is no longer needed (i.e. user scrolls away from it)
- Implement parallel download limit while keeping application responsible
- Implement page-based list retrieval (download next page when reaching end of list)
- Cache downloaded images on disk
- Apply blur to image segment under image title
